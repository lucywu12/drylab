Welcome to our drylab repository for our 2023 Hopkins iGEM team!

A few folders that may be of interest:
1. repeats: A script to identify repeats in a FASTA file of amino acids based on a user input pattern.
2. BOTS: A django and python combination that shortens a sequence to pass IDT. Has a more user-friendly interface. From the 2019 Calgary iGEM team!
3. The original script BOTS is based off of. Runs with user input in the terminal. By Brian Weitzner!
4. gc_script: A twofold script - the first part (frequency) calculates and visualizes the number of consecutive GC and AT base pairs, and the second part (percentage) calculates and visualizes the concentration of GC in a shifting window across the entire sequence
